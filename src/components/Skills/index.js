                    As a software engineer, I'm proficient in building scalable, maintainable, and 
                    efficient applications using a variety of languages including Python, Go, 
                    JavaScript, HTML, and many others. I'm also a strong advocate for using modern 
                    technologies and best practices when writing code.

                    My professional journey includes a year-long Co-Op placement at KOHO Financial, 
                    where I used my skills as a Backend Software Developer to solve a wide variety
                    of problems. Some of my major achievements while working at KOHO include optimizing
                    database migration and user data backfill processes by building custom internal
                    tools, as well as collaborating with cross-functional teams to release 3 deliverables
                    on-time, leading to an increase in customer-base by over 200,000.

                    Before that, I worked at Code Ninjas as a part time Coding Instructor, where I 
                    designed and led the FIRST LEGO Robotics competition team and Python program, 
                    leading to marked improvement in our students' coding proficiency, problem-solving 
                    skills, and teamwork!

                On top of everything else, I've got a bunch of personal projects to show for: some of them 
                deployed, such as this website you're on right now, to a <a href="https://melodia-streamer.netlify.app/#"> proof of concept music streaming service</a>,
                and a <a href="https://tick.up.railway.app">todo-list manager</a>. The rest of my non-hosted
                projects can be found on my <a href="https://github.com/mchappyneil/About_Me">GitHub!</a>
